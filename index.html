            <h3>IMPORTANT NOTICE</h3>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">On January 27th, 2022, the main Wine Buddies Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/winebuddies_nft" target="_new">@winebuddies_nft</a> was suddenly suspended without any reason given. Several appeals have been sent but Twitter has never responded nor given a reason. This was very unfortunate as it was the primary means of marketing for this project. Several interviews had been arranged and the first giveaway was days away. With the sudden suspension, all events were cancelled as the project regrouped. As a personal favor, please reach out to <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport">@TwitterSupport</a> and ask for @winebuddies_nft to be unsuspended. </p>
